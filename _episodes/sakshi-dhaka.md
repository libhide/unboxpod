Ratik speaks to Sakshi, a Masters student at JNU studying Linguistics. Sakshi's journey of finding a niche that she truly enjoys being in is a classic example of how [there are no right decisions in life](https://www.raptitude.com/2018/07/right-decision/).

The conversation that follows takes you through a multitude of things in Sakshi's life. There is talk about her experience with boarding school to her quintessential DU-experience and to finally the choice that introduced her to Linguistics. And well, the rest is history.
